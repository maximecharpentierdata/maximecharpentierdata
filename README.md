### Hi there 👋

- 👨‍🎓 I am graduated from CentraleSupélec (Paris-Saclay University) engineering school in Data Sciences.
- 📊 I chose to focus on Data Sciences and Data engineering because I think data and modeling can be powerful ressources to tackle challenges and to optimize processes.
- 💻 I’m fluent in Python, Pandas/Scikit-learn/Tensorflow/PyTorch and in UNIX environments. I am trying to improve my DevOps practices and I wish to increase my skills regarding data engineering (GCP, AWS, Kubernetes...) in order to master the full value chain of data.
- 🏛️ 🌍 As a 21st century engineer, I feel involved in the main challenges of our time, especially in the energy transition, by trying to educate myself and to reduce my impact.
- 💪 I love (and need) to feel strongly involved in the projects I am working on. This involvement is my fuel to get me go on and progress.
- 🏃 I like running, cooking, and horror movies.
